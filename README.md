# GitHub Pages Branch

This branch (`gh-pages`) is dedicated to hosting the static website for this project via GitHub Pages.

**Do not make direct edits to files in this branch.**

The content of this branch is automatically generated from the `main` branch. Any changes to the website should be made in the `main` branch, and then the static assets should be built and deployed to this `gh-pages` branch.
